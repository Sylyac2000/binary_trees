## 0x1D. C - Binary trees

## Requirements
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc 9.3.0
* Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)


## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
What is a binary tree
What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Description of what each file shows:
0. New node
1. Insert left
2. Insert right
3. Delete
4. Is leaf
5. Is root
6. Pre-order traversal
